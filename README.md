# Bootcamp challenge 1: Horiseon Page.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
What was your motivation? This weeks challenge involved a crucial aspect for web development and that involved 'Accessibility'. This specifically involved taking existing code and refactoring it (refector is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a specific standard. A crucial learning in part of the challenge was to use a rule called 'Scout Rule' which eessentially recommends that you leave the code a little cleaner than how you got it.

Part of the problem with the challenge was that with the given code, most of the semantic elements within the HTML document were labeled as DIV classes and had to be changed to either 'section', 'article', 'aside'. More so there were redundancies in the CSS.style sheet that were doing the same thing and did not need to be repeated and counld be consolidated.

Through playing with the CSS sheet, HTML, and going to a tutoring session, I learned that within the HTML elements can be defined as a class and a class section can have a ruled appled to the entire section rather than mapping out the same repeating function for several classes. 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

Header
Aside
Section
Navigation links

## Tests

While editing the HTML page, in order to see what each element was doing I opened the file in VS code and opened with a live server to see the changes instantly. Afterward I used the same to manipulate the CSS to see what each function was responsible for and what removing some functions did/did not do.
