# Bootcamp challenge 1: Horiseon Page.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
What was your motivation? This weeks challenge involved a crucial aspect for web development and that involved 'Accessibility'. This specifically involved taking existing code and refactoring it (refector is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a specific standard. A crucial learning in part of the challenge was to use a rule called 'Scout Rule' which eessentially recommends that you leave the code a little cleaner than how you got it.

Part of the problem with the challenge was that with the given code, most of the semantic elements within the HTML document were labeled as DIV classes and had to be changed to either 'section', 'article', 'aside'.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
